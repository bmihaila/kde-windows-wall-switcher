kde-windows-wall-switcher
=========================

A window switcher for KDE Kwin.

**KDE store:** [https://store.kde.org/p/1112559](https://store.kde.org/p/1112559)

---

### Description:

Displays a grid like wall of the present windows with close buttons. In addition to the switch window shortcuts it can be navigated using the arrow keys or mouse.

Started out by fixing a bug concerning the mouse behavior in "present windows clone" http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Present+Windows+Clone?content=154858 and continued with tinkering with the design and various code cleanups.

For installation either do "plasmapkg -t windowswitcher -i filename" or go to "System Settings -> Window Behavior -> Task Switcher" under Visualization and use the "Get Hot New Stuff" Button next to the drop down list of switcher effects.
